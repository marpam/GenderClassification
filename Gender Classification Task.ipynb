    "From the results obtained, it is clear that the best accuracy is obtained with the Multi-layer Perceptron and with the Convolutional Neural Network. However, we first evaluate the performance of the other algorithms taken into consideration, making comparisons regarding accuracy, and then arrive at the two best performances just mentioned.\n",
    "Starting from Naive Bayes, we can observe a slightly lower accuracy than the other algorithms and this is probably due to the fact that NB is an extremely simple classifier and therefore a stronger algorithm is worth trying, even if it still has a very good accuracy.\n",
    "Looking at the Decision Tree and the Random Forest, we can see better accuracy of the latter than the former. This result was expected as the Random Forest is formed by multiple Decision Trees and, as we have already expressed above, takes all the Decision Trees to have a more precise result.\n",
    "As for the Logistic Regression, the accuracy is very high as we expected, being the Logistic Regression a very good algorithm when considering categorical labels. \n",
    "The K-Nearest Neighbor and the Support Vector Machine show a slightly higher accuracy than the Naive Bayes, both being two more complex algorithms than NB.\n",
    "Then evaluating the accuracy of the Perceptron and the Multi-Layer Perceptron, we notice a great improvement of the second. This is due to the fact that the MLP is a set of perceptrons, i.e. it considers not only one neuron as the Perceptron algorithm, but a series of neurons and therefore is able to provide a better result.\n",
    "In conclusion, the Convolutional Neural Network is able to provide an excellent prediction of the gender of the speakers and could be even better probably by increasing the number of epochs or considering higher convolutional layers."
